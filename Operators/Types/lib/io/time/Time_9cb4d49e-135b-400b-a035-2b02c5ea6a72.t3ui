  "Description": "Returns the current time from the \"context\".\n\nIn most situations this will be the playback time in bars (not seconds!) as number. But this could also be overridden by [SetCommandTime], [TimeClip], during beat tapping, or during rendering an image sequence. Like many music applications, Tooll uses bars to represent time. This allows to easily sync animations to varying soundtracks or BPM-rates. At 120 Beats per Minute 1 bar is equivalent to 2 seconds.\n\nTips:\n\n- Add a [Modulo] or other math operators to repeat a time range.\n- Consider using [AnimValue] for other deterministic time values.\n- If you want to restart the timer during playback, try the [Modulo] operator.\n- Consider [RunTime] to get time time since application start.\n\nAKA: clock, seconds, bars",
