Comments
-----------
So you expected a real demo?! Bad luck. This is just a first render test
of our new demo engine. After a year of development we needed a first
proof-of-concept to check if things are actually working.

If you're interested in doing some early usability tests or having lengthly
discussions about the right data flow direction in a node graph, drop
me an email or meet us at a demoscene party, once this sofa-crap is over.
